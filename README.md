# Go Falling Sand

This very simple project is used as a personal introduction to Golang. The project is to visualize each step of different sorting algorithms controlled by the user. 
Made with the Ebiten library. More algorithms may be added in the future.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
   
2. Install dependencies (Ebiten):

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   
3. Run the code:

   ```bash
   go run .
